**Introduction**

Many of the models submitting to the COVID-19 Forecast Hub incorporate data about social distancing, mobility, or non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). We look to compare these models with each other and with models that do not incorporate such data and evaluate their performance.

TODO: 
1. define social distancing , NPIs , mobility 
2. 


**Methods** 

*Step 1: Create Table of Model Characteristics*

* Look for which models use social distancing data 
* Data used by models (demographic data, hospitalization data) 
* Model type (SEIR, Baysian, statistical) 
* Look for models that fit criteria but do not include social distancing data 

*Step 2: Inclusion Criteria*

* Locations: Florida, Texas, Massachusetts, New York, California, Michigan
* Time period: November 1 2020 - December 31 2020
* Target: Incident Cases 
* Horizons:
* Models: 
  * 2 models with both mobility and social distancing
    * CU-select, OliverWyman-Navigator, JHUAPL-Bucky
  * 2 models with neither mobility nor social distancing
    * COVIDhub-baseline, LANL-GrowthRate
  * 2 models with only mobility 
    * IowaStateLW-STEM, UVA-Ensemble
  * 1 model with only social distancing
    * JHU_IDD-CovidSP

*Step 3: Evaluation graphs* 

* After deciding on inclusion criteria, use covidhubUtils to score forecasts and determine which models are best. 

*Step 4: Linear regression*

* Exposure / variable : social distancing, data sources, model type

**Key Information about the Locations** 

(maybe change timelines to just 1 key date from summer 2020, winter 2020, and now)

Three of the locations that were chosen either never had a mask mandate or removed the mask mandate early in 2021 (FL, TX, MA) while the other three locations plan to remove mask mandates sometime in the summer of 2021 (NY, CA, MI).
