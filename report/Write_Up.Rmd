**Introduction**

Many of the models submitting to the COVID-19 Forecast Hub incorporate data about social distancing, mobility, or non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). We look to compare these models with each other and with models that do not incorporate such data and evaluate their performance.

**Methods** 

*Step 1: Create Table of Model Characteristics*

* Look for which models use social distancing data 
* Data used by models (demographic data, hospitalization data) 
* Model type (SEIR, Baysian, statistical) 
* Look for models that fit criteria but do not include social distancing data 

*Step 2: Inclusion Criteria*

* Locations: Florida, Texas, Massachusetts, New York, California, Michigan
* Time period: November 1 2020 - December 31 2020
* Target: Incident Cases 
* Horizons:
* Models: 
  + 2 models with both mobility and social distancing
    + CU-select, OliverWynman-Navigator, JHUAPL-Bucky
  + 2 models with neither mobility nor social distancing
    + COVIDhub-baseline, LANL-GrowthRate
  + 2 models with only mobility 
    + IowaStateLW-STEM, UVA-Ensemble
  + 1 model with only social distancing
    +JHU_IDD-CovidSP

*Step 3: Evaluation graphs* 

* After deciding on inclusion criteria, use covidhubUtils to score forecasts and determine which models are best. 

*Step 4: Linear regression*

* Exposure / variable : social distancing, data sources, model type
